# Java Aquarium Lifecycle Simulator

A Java-based simulation of an aquarium ecosystem, created as a project for a java college course.

## Overview

This project simulates the lifecycle of aquatic organisms in an aquarium. The simulation models the interactions between different types of fish, plants, and environmental factors, allowing users to observe population changes and ecosystem dynamics over time.

## Features

- Simulation of fish, plants, and other aquarium lifeforms
- Life cycles including birth, aging, and death
- Environmental parameters (e.g., water quality, temperature, food availability)
- Visualization of the aquarium state
- User controls to adjust simulation parameters
